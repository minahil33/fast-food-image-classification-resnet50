# fast-food-image-classification-resnet50
This project implements fast food image classification using a pretrained ResNet-50 model in PyTorch. Transfer learning and fine-tuning are applied to improve performance. The system includes data preprocessing, training, validation, testing, confusion matrix visualization, and detailed performance evaluation using standard classification metrics.
